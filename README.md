# openssl.csr.bash
bash script to use openssl req utility to make a certificate signing request with subject fields

## install [openssl][1]

ubuntu

    sudo apt-get install openssl

red hat

    sudo yum install openssl

## usage
change the variables at the top of `openssl.csr.bash` to match your needs: `site_name`, `email_address`, `organization`, etc.

execute the script

    ./openssl.csr.bash

## verify certificate signing request

    openssl req -noout -text -in example.com.csr

## verify signed certificate

    openssl x509 -noout -text -in example.com.crt

## converting formats (.crt/.pem/.cer & .key) to .pfx
Microsoft's IIS uses the `pfx` format, so you will need to [convert it][7]

    openssl pkcs12 -export -out example.com.pfx -inkey example.com.key -in example.com.crt

## verify server installation

    openssl s_client -showcerts -servername example.com -connect example.com:443

## DIY
[here is an end-to-end guide][3] for creating a root certificate authority,
intermediate CA, certificate signing requests, and certs

## SAN ([subject alternative names][8]) certificates
- sometimes you want one certificate to use with multiple sub-domain names, such as `www.example.com`, `test.example.com`, and `another.example.com`, but you don't want to be so permissive as to issue a [wildcard certificate][6] `*.example.com`
- sometimes your alias domains are not sub-domains, such as `example.com` and `example.org`

this script is written to properly generate SAN certificates, but if you're interested, then [here is a guide][4]
for creating the configuration file used to generate the CSR.

as an addendum to the [end-to-end guide][3], you will need to [modify your intermediate CA configuration][5]
by adding `copy_extensions = copy` to the `[CA_default]` section

***caution***: this will allow a vulnerability for other people to sneak in unauthorized domains in their
certificate signing request. if you are signing requests for other people, then make sure that you
**review** the request **before** signing it

    openssl req -text -noout -verify -in example.com.csr

Thanks to Jeff Walton for [helping me figure out][2] which default configuration file to use.
